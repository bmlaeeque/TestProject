	 * 
	 * Q)Why String is Immutable is in java?
	 * ----->suppose our string object is not immutable and if we have 5 variable and all these are pointing to same object 
	 * 		and if we change the value of object from one variable then all variable value will be affected
	 * 
	 * Q)What is the diff between StringBuffer and StringBuilder ?
	 * ----->stringbuffer are thread safe(execution is fast)
	 *  	stringbuilder is not thread safe(execution is slow)
	 *      
	 *      StringBuffer less efficient than Stringbuilder
