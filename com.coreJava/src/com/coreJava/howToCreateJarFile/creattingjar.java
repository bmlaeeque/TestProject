 *Q) how to create a jar file?
 *			1)Right click on project and select import
 *
 *			2)and Expand the java Node and select jar file
 *
 *			3)in the JAr File Specification page select the resources that you want to store jar file (src/com/corejava/jarFilelocation)
 *
 *			4)Select the appropriate checkbox to specify whether you want to Export generated class files and resources or Export Java source files and resources. (Note: Selected resources are exported in both cases.

			5)MPORTANT: In this example the project keeps the source code in a folder named src. Your project may have a different set up. Be sure you expand the tree to show the default package and that the .java files are checked on the right. Alternatively deselect the option that says Export generated class files and resources and select the option that says Export Java source files and resources. For CS307 we want the .java files. We do not want or need the .class files. If you do not turn in your source files, the .java files, your assignment grade will be 0
