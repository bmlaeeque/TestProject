	 * Q)can we declare constructor in Abstract class ?
	 * 		yes
	 * Q) can we create a object of abstract class ?
	 * 		no
	 * Q) if we can't create the object of abstract class then what is the use of it?
	 * 		when sub class is extending to  abstract class the internally called by jvm to initialize the super class member variable 
	 * 
	 * Q)when we will go for Abstract class and when we will go for interface?
	 * 		(a)if we want to provide totally different implementation to sub-classes the we should go for Interface 
	 * 
	 * 		(b)and if we want to provide some common implementation to sub-classes and some different 
	 * 			implementation to sub-classes then we should go for abstract class
	 * Q)can we declare concurrent method in abstract class?
	 * 		yes we can declare both abstract method and concurrent method in abstract class.
